Local Scout is a rails web application that manages your budget and vacation time against trips you might consider taking and lets you browse trip ideas by other users! 

You can track the trips that you have taken and comment on them if you find them good or bad. 

Additionally, there is a VIP Trips section that holds all trips over $1000 for those with a more luxurious taste.
