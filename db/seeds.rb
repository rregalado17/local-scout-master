# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# tours = Tour.create([{title: 'Playa Blanca Tour', destination: Destination.create([{destination = 'Cartagena'}]), price: 50, duration: 1, description: 'Day trip to the beautiful beach of Playa Blanca. Tour includes boat ride, lunch and pick up.'}])
# users = User.creat([{name: 'Max Power', username: 'mpower', password_digest: '12345', budget: 100000, vacation_time: 100}])
